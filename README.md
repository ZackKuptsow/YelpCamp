<h1>YelpCamp</h1>
<p>I have never had a formal education with HTML/CSS/Javascript. Most of my experience was learning on the fly in class, so I took the opportunity over the last month of winter session to take Colt Steele's Web Developer's Bootcamp on Udemy. <br>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Link to course and description</a></p>
<p>This course allowed me to go back to the basics and solidify my comfort with the fundamentals of web development and more.
<br>I can honestly say I am a better developer and learned picked up a lot of tricks that I would have otherwise missed.
<br>I do not take credit for the originality of the code, but I did make some edits to what was taught.</p>
